Thank you for purchasing our asset! We hope you enjoy Spectre: Stylized Ghost Shader, and you find it useful.

To setup your project for the built-in render pipeline, ensure the color mode is set to linear and the PostProcessing V2 package is installed for best results.

For use with URP projects, import the URP .unitypackage (Distant Lands/Spectre/Custom Render Pipelines/Import for URP) and enable the depth texture in the URP settings.
